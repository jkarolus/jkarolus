I am a researcher at the [Embedded Intelligence group](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/embedded-intelligence) at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web). My research focuses on establishing guidelines and techniques for [Proficiency-Aware Systems](https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.28900) and [Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence](https://www.humane-ai.eu/). You can find publications, videos and talks on my [personal webpage](https://jakob-karolus.de/).

For selected projects, source code and extensive documentation is available here on github:
