I am a researcher at the [Human-Centered Ubiquitous Media group](http://www.en.um.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at the [Institute of Informatics](https://www.ifi.lmu.de/front-page-en?set_language=en) at the [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html). My research focuses on establishing guidelines and techniques for Proficiency-Aware Systems based on Ubiquitous Sensing Technologies.
